Calculator
==================

In the first year of my university, I learnt some data structures and managed to use *STACK* and *QUEUE* to implement a calculator.

The queue structure is used in parsing tokens in the expression.

The stack is used to calculate the value of the expression.

Within the whole app, the most important technique is [Shunting-yard algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm).
